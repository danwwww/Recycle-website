NOTE ON ALL FUNCTIONALITIES: This website utilises session data, particularly the user data harvested when you first log in. Many of the
functions are unavailable when not logged in, and will reroute you to the login page. Please ensure you are logged in to one of the sample
accounts provided (or create your own with the register function) when you test the functionalities :)

Sample logins for your convenience (we recommend you use one of these, as they have more interesting recycling data already in the system):
1) Email: "neffj@student.unimelb.edu.au", password = "passw0rd2"

2) Email: "test1@gmail.com", password = "test1pass"

3) Email: "voal2001@gmail.com", password = "Tweiml2001"


Functionality 1: The Website will have a userbase that can register accounts and log in.

Users will be able to log in to see their own personal homepage and use the website, and without being logged people cannot access the website's content.
Users will be able to register a new account with an email address (must be not already in the system), a password and a username. They will 
then be able to log in with this account if it was successfully created, or be promted if it was not.

The landing page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com) allows you to log in with an existing user. e.g. "test1@gmail.com", "test1pass"

The landing page allows you to click to make an account (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/register), and create a new user.
For example you could create the user: Username = testingRegister, password = pass, email = fakeEmail1@gmail.com, then log in on the landing page
with the newly added account. However trying to add test1@gmail.com to a new account will alert the user that the email is already in the system.

The home page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/home) shows your username and allows you to navigate to other functions
NOTE: The home page redirect you to the login page if you try to visit it directly without first logging in.

Functionality 2: The website will contain a directory of items and instructions on how to recycle them that can be searched for a given item.

Users will be able to navigate to recycling directory and select an item to highlight, alternatively they can search for an item whereby the list will
automatically begin to match results using XML functionality.

The directory page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/directory) allows you to see the recycling directory from the MongoDB database

Functionality 3: Users can enter recycling items.

When users have selected an item from the recycling directory as above, they can then select the item to have it add to their score for
the day, thereby gaining points for entering their recycling and allowing them to keep track of their individual efforts.

The directory page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/directory) allows you to add recycling items
The home page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/home) allows you to see the increased score from adding the items

Functionality 4: Users can view their recycling progress in an easy to understand format.

Users can see their recycling summary on their home page in the form of a coloured bar graph broken down by points per day. The progress is
reset each day so that users can track their week-in-review from the home page.

The grade page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/grade) shows a detailed breakdown of the grade for the week
The home page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/home) shows a graph-only summary of the grade for the week

Users can change their username, bio or Avatar from one account page so that they can personalise their own account to suit their tastes.

The account page (https://frozen-reaches-24378.herokuapp.com/account) allows you to view your account and customise your details
